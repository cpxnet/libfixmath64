# libfixmath64

A derived version of https://github.com/PetteriAimonen/libfixmath, converted into Q31.32 (Q31) format for larger integer range. This library suits best to 64-bit machines with no FPO available.

Some of the tests are not converted yet completely, but most of them work and you can run them. The rest of the original repository (the sin LUT for example) shall be added later.
